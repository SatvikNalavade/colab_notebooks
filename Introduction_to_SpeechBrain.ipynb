        "\n",
        "SpeechBrain is an **open-source** **all-in-one** speech toolkit based on **PyTorch**. It is designed to make the research and development of speech technology easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Motivation**\n",
        "There are many speech and audio processing tasks of great practical and scientific interest.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the past, the dominant approach was to develop a **different toolkit for each different task**. Nevertheless, learning several toolkits is **time-demanding**, might require knowledge of **different programming languages**,  and forces you to familiarize yourself with  **different code styles and standards** (e.g., data readers).\n",
        "\n",
        "Nowadays, most of these tasks can be implemented with the same **deep learning**  technology.\n",
        "We thus explicitly designed SpeechBrain to natively support **multiple speech processing tasks**. We think that this might make much easier the life of speech developers. Moreover, we think that the combination of different speech technologies in single **end-to-end** and **fully differential system** will be crucial in the development of future speech technologies.\n",
        "\n",
        "We did our best to design a toolkit which is:\n",
        "*   *Easy to use*\n",
        "*   *Easy to customize*\n",
        "*  *Flexible*\n",
        "* *Modular*\n",

        "\n",
        "You can thus use speechbrain to convert *speech-to-text*, to perform authentication using `speaker verification`, to enhance the quality of the speech signal, to combine the information from multiple microphones, and for many other things.\n",
        "\n",
        "More precisely, SpeechBrain currently supports many conversational AI technologies, including:\n",

        "- Speech Separation\n",
